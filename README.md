<b>Version History</b><br>
<br>
February 18th 2019<br>
-The SetupMinecraft.sh script will now update all of your scripts to the latest version when ran and reinstall the startup service<br>
-Implemented a workaround for Java 9 installation since the ca-certificates-java package broke in Raspbian on the 16th<br>
<br>
February 15th 2019<br>
-Server now starts correctly on Raspbian Full (Raspbian Lite still highly recommended due to more available memory)<br>
-Added network connectivity check before attempting to update server - skips update if no connection available to prevent .jar corruption<br>
-Service now waits up to 20 seconds for network connectivity before starting up to prevent service starting before server gets an IP address<br>
-Fixed typo in stop.sh that was causing server to say it wasn't running when it was<br>
-Removed unnecessary sleep time on stop.sh script so it returns as soon as the minecraft server closes<br>
-Added automatic backups performed when server starts (located in minecraft/backups)<br>
<br>
February 9th 2019<br>
-Added check to make sure service isn't already running when started<br>
<br>
February 3rd 2019<br>
-Added optional service configuration to start minecraft automatically on boot<br>
-Added optional daily reboot configuration via Cron in setup script<br>
-Added a check in the installer to make sure Java was installed properly before continuing<br>
-Installer script now goes into the started screen window after installation<br>
-Server now checks for updates to the server on startup<br>
<br>
February 2nd 2019<br>
-Script now checks to make sure we are running on the ARMv7 CPU architecture with 1024MB of RAM to ensure Java 9 works<br>
-Script helps you overclock SD card and change gpu_mem to 16MB<br>
-Increased memory usage of server from 800MB to 850MB due to gpu_mem tweak<br>
-Improved reliability and validation checks on setup script<br>
